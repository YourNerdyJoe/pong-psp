Pong Clone for PSP
==================
Written circa 2012 (I would like to believe my skills have improved significantly since making this).
It's the only thing I ever made for the PSP.
I mean it's really an SDL app that uses joystick input instead of mouse and keyboard.
Also don't let the .cpp extension fool you, it's more or less just C code.

Controls
--------
- D-pad -> move
- Start -> "autopilot"

Instead of pausing, pressing start toggles the player between manual control and using ai.

Put the EBOOT.PBP and font directory onto your PSP to play.
